# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Homework project

## Background

We will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Deliverables

- [static/js/app.js](./static/js/app.js): The bulk of the javascript code for this homework assignment
- [static/js/bonus.js](./static/js/bonus.js): Plotting the gauge for washing frequency 
- [index.html](./index.html): The master html file
